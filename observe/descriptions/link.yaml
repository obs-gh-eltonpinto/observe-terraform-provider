  A link connects two datasets through a resource key.
schema:
  source: |
    OID for the source dataset.
  target: |
    OID for the target dataset. 
  label: |
    A human-readable label for the link.
  fields: |
    A collection of field mappings on which to link source and target datasets.
    Each element of the array can be written as a colon separated string, e.g.
    `source_column:target_column`. If the source and target fields have the
    same name, the target field name can be omitted, i.e. `col:col` can be
    written as `col`.
