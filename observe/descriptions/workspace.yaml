  Most objects you can create on Observe - such as datasets, monitors
  and dashboards - live within workspaces. An Observe workspace provides
  isolation between usecases within an Observe account. You can use workspaces to
  segregate between different environments, teams or tenants. 

  All Observe accounts have a `Default` workspace. This workspace cannot be deleted.
